ORDER BY table_name;

-- Verify sample data
SELECT 'businesses' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.businesses
UNION ALL
SELECT 'coupons', COUNT(*) FROM public.coupons
UNION ALL
SELECT 'users', COUNT(*) FROM public.users
UNION ALL
SELECT 'redemptions', COUNT(*) FROM public.redemptions;

-- Test RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive
