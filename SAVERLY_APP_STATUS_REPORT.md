## 🔍 What Was Wrong With The Original Health Check

The original health check reported false negatives because:

1. **Selector Issues**: Used incorrect Playwright selectors (`text*="Saverly"` is invalid syntax)
2. **Timing Problems**: Didn't wait for React to fully render content
3. **Content Detection**: Looked for wrong elements instead of actual rendered content
4. **Missing Context**: Didn't account for client-side routing and dynamic content
