# Enterprise Architecture Roadmap for Saverly Platform

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive enterprise-scale architecture upgrade path for the Saverly coupon marketplace platform. The current architecture (React + Supabase + Stripe) provides a solid foundation but requires strategic enhancements to support 100K+ concurrent users and enterprise-grade requirements.

**Current Architecture Assessment**: ✅ Production-Ready Foundation
**Enterprise Readiness**: 🔄 Requires Strategic Scaling
**Target Capacity**: 100K+ concurrent users
**Revenue Target**: $50K+ ARR scaling to $10M+ ARR

---

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Current Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 + Vite 7.0.4 + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Payments**: Stripe integration
- **Maps**: Google Maps API integration
- **Hosting**: Netlify (implied)
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query

### Current Strengths
✅ **Solid Foundation**: Modern React stack with TypeScript
✅ **Comprehensive Features**: Complete coupon marketplace functionality
✅ **Security**: Robust authentication and payment processing
✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite (Vitest + Playwright)
✅ **Database Design**: Well-structured PostgreSQL schema with RLS

### Current Limitations for Enterprise Scale
❌ **Single Point of Failure**: Supabase as sole backend
❌ **Limited Caching**: No Redis or CDN caching layer
❌ **Monolithic Frontend**: Single React app limits scalability
❌ **No Message Queue**: Synchronous processing limits throughput
❌ **Limited Analytics**: Basic tracking without real-time insights
❌ **No Auto-scaling**: Static infrastructure configuration

CREATE DATABASE CLUSTER saverly_production (
  primary_node: "write operations + critical reads",
  read_replica_1: "user queries + search operations", 
  read_replica_2: "analytics + reporting queries",
  read_replica_3: "business dashboard queries"
);

-- 2. Partitioning Strategy
-- Partition redemptions by date for performance
CREATE TABLE redemptions_2024_q4 PARTITION OF redemptions
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-10-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

-- Partition analytics events by date  
CREATE TABLE analytics_events_2024_12 PARTITION OF analytics_events
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-12-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

-- 3. Advanced Indexing
-- Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_coupons_location_active 
  ON coupons(business_uid, active, start_date, end_date)
  WHERE active = true;

-- GIN indexes for full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_businesses_search 
  ON businesses USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description));

-- 4. Query Optimization
-- Materialized views for complex analytics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW business_performance_summary AS
SELECT 
  b.uid,
  b.name,
  COUNT(c.uid) as total_coupons,
  COUNT(r.uid) as total_redemptions,
  AVG(br.rating) as avg_rating,
  SUM(r.savings_amount) as total_savings_provided
FROM businesses b
LEFT JOIN coupons c ON b.uid = c.business_uid
LEFT JOIN redemptions r ON c.uid = r.coupon_uid  
LEFT JOIN business_reviews br ON b.uid = br.business_uid
GROUP BY b.uid, b.name;

-- 5. Connection Pooling Configuration
-- PgBouncer configuration for connection efficiency
pool_mode = transaction
max_client_conn = 1000
default_pool_size = 250
max_db_connections = 100
```
